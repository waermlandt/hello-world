# hello-world
My first repository, as one might guess.

I am a nursing student based in Stockholm, Sweden. My first contact with GitHub was when I was looking for a way to make a portfolio and wanted to do it with a static site generator. Thus I am currently exploring Hugo, with the Academic Theme. This is a repository to better understand how GitHub works and how I can learn and contribute.
